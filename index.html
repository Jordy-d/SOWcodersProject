 <h1>Chess Basics</h1>
 

  
 <h1 class= "intro"  <p>Chess is an intricate two player game that takes knowledge of the pieces, strategy and concentration to play.So this website is here to help people who want to learn the basics of chess.</p> </h1>
  <h2> The aim of Chess</h2>
  <p>The ultimate goal of chess is to execute a checkmate - to trap your opponent's king.So if you're in checkmate, it means your king is under attack and there's no way to save it from your opponent's attack.For the chess pieces, In addition to moving, each chess piece has the ability to kill a chess piece of the opposing color if it moves to its place.</p>
  <h2> Check</h2>
  <p>When a king is attacked, it is called check Since a king can never be captured, the term "check" is used when a king is threatened.</p>
  <h2> Stalemate</h2>
  <p>When neither side has any legal options, the condition is known as a stalemate. The game will conclude in a draw if the king is NOT in check but no piece can be moved without putting the king in check.</p>
  
  <h2>The Chess board</h2>
  <img src="Chess.jpg" alt="Chess board">
  <p> A chess board is shown above. It has a square shape with 64 smaller squares inside. The chess pieces are arranged in 8 rows by 8 columns. It has a checkered design with two colors, one light and one dark. The board is set up during play so that each player's near-right corner square is a light square.</p>
  
<h2>Pieces in Chess </h2>
  <ul class="pieces">
    <li> Pawn</li>
    <li> Knight</li>
    <li> Bishop</li>
    <li> Rook</li>
    <li> King</li>
    <li> Queen</li>
    </ul> </h2>
  <h3> Pawn </h3>
  <p> A chess board has a total of eight pawns.Each pawn is worth one point. Pawns move in small steps, but there are eight of them.
A pawn advances one square straight ahead. It does not move backward.It also doesn't jump over other pieces</p>

<p>The pawn captures differently than its normal moves. Pawns can only take other pieces diagonally forward to a neighboring square. </p>
  <p> On the pawns first move it can move two squares. but on all other moves it only moves one square.A pawn is removed from a chess board when it reaches the other side. Promoted pawns are replaced by the same color queen, rook, bishop, or knight. On the board, these promoted pieces replace the pawn.</p>
  <p> below is a video on how the pawn moves.</p>

 <h3> The Knight</h3>
  <p> Each player starts the game with two knights. When arranging your chess set, position the knights between the bishop and the rook on the row closest to each player.</p>
<img class="Knight"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Chess_piece_-_White_knight.JPG">
  <img class="Knight"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Chess_piece_-_Black_knight.JPG/134px-Chess_piece_-_Black_knight.JPG">
<p>A chess knight is worth three points, which is the same as a bishop in terms of relative value.The knight advances in a 'L' shape. two   vertical squares followed by one horizontal square or vice versa.</p>
 <p> Below is a video on how the knight moves</p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGoT8FR0O_8?start=7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <h3> The Bishop</h3>
 <p> Each player gets 2 bishops. They are set up in between the knight and the rook. Like the knight, the bishop is worth 3 points. It moves diagonally in an direction and it can move any number of spaces(diagonally of course) </p>
  
<img class="Bishop"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Chess_piece_-_White_bishop.JPG">
  <img class="Bishop"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Chess_piece_-_Black_bishop.JPG/131px-Chess_piece_-_Black_bishop.JPG">
  <p>Every bishop is limited to half of the board because it can only move on the light or dark squares. A light-squared bishop may only move on light squares, whereas a dark-squared bishop may only move on dark squares.The bishop cannot jump over any pieces</p>
  <p> Below is a video on how the bishop moves</p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_y3eA21rD1w?start=3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <h3> The Rook</h3>
  <p>The rook is one of the more valuable pieces on a chess board. It is worth 5 points and each player gets two of them. At the begining of the game the rooks are placed in the corners of the board.</p>
  <img class="Rook"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Chess_piece_-_White_rook.JPG">
  <img class="Rook"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Chess_piece_-_Black_rook.JPG/131px-Chess_piece_-_Black_rook.JPG">

  <p>The rook can move forward, backward, and sideways, but not diagonally (like a queen or a bishop).It can move any amount of spaces in those directions if there isnt a piece blocking it. It cannot jump over any pieces. </p>
  <p> When capturing with a rook it can take any of the opposing pieces in its path. If the rook is blocked (as it is in the beginning position), it cannot move</p>
  <p> Below is a video on how the rook moves</p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0OcqDs1QJo?start=11" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <h3>The Queen </h3>
  <p> The queen is the most valuable piece on a chess board. It is worth 7 points. It is very useful as it can move stright in any direction, forwards, backwards, sideways and diagonally.</p>
  <p>The queen is not restricted to one square. The queen can move like a rook, freely moving up and down any file and left and right on any rank.Like a bishop, it can move freely on any diagonal.</p>
  <img class="Queen"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Chess_piece_-_Black_queen.JPG/133px-Chess_piece_-_Black_queen.JPG">
     <img class="Queen"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Chess_piece_-_White_queen.jpg/131px-Chess_piece_-_White_queen.jpg">
  <p> At the start of the game each player gets 1 queen and it is positioned in betweeen the bishop and the king. The queen always starts on the color of itself. So the white queen would start on the white square and the black queen would start on the black square.</p>

  <p> The queen cannot jump over pieces. It captures the opposing pieces in its path.</p>
  <p> Below is a video on how the queen moves</p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwgwI0wnULU?start=3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <h3> The King</h3>
 <p> While the king isn't the most powerful piece in chess, it is certainly the most important. The entire game of chess revolves around it. There is only one king given to each player in chess. You aim to keep it out of danger.</p>
  <img class="King"src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/pete/phpzr0JSD.jpeg">
  <img class="King" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Chess_piece_-_Black_king.JPG/133px-Chess_piece_-_Black_king.JPG">
  <p>When compared to other chess pieces, the king's movement is restricted. It has the ability to move one square in any direction. It cannot jump over pieces. The king is placed between the bishop and the queen </p>
  <p> The king can never move into danger and it can never be removed from the board. The ony point in time when a king can move two places is when you castle.</p>
  <p> Castling is the only moment in chess when two pieces can move at the same time, and it is the only time when a piece other than the knight can move over another piece. All in one move, the king travels two squares to the left or right, while the rook moves over and in front of the king.</p>
  <p> Castling is permitted only if neither the king nor the rook have moved before, the squares between the king and the rook are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end up on a square attacked by an opposing piece.</p>

  <p> Below is a video on how the king moves</p>

  <h2>   Last words</h2>
 <p> The fundamentals of chess go beyond this. Chess requires strategy if you want to win. This entails being aware of both your own pieces and those of your opponent, as well as considering how to checkmate them. To become better at chess, you must practice a lot. Both offline and online gaming are available. Therefore, you can utilize an online chess app even if you don't have anyone  to play or practice.</p>
